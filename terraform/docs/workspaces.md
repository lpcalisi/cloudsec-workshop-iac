# Workspaces

Terraform Workspaces allow to create us differents environments from the same configuration files and it creates a state for each one.

  Some use cases could be:
  
  * Multiple deploy environments such as Production, Staging, etc
  * Many instances for the same configuration in many differents entity. ie: many AWS Accounts or many regions in the same account
  



* How we can create new workspaces?
